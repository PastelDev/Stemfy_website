# Coming Soon Ideas

This document captures the concepts for simulations and challenges that are not yet public.

## Simulations
- Bridge Builder: Design a 2D bridge with limited materials, then test it under loads to explore forces, stress, and stability.
- Mandelbrot Set Explorer: Zoom and pan the fractal, experiment with color palettes, and save striking coordinates or snapshots.

## Challenges
- Bridge Master: Build the most durable bridge within constraints and share the best load or stability score.
- Mandelbrot Zoom: Find the most stunning zoom location and share the coordinates and screenshot.
